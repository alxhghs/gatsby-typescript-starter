It can be confusing getting started with GTM. In this post, I will walk through some important terms and show you how to add GTM to your website.</p>\n<h2>Important terms to get started</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager#topic=3441530\">Source: Google Tag Manager Help</a></p>\n<h3>Google Tag Manager (GTM)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update tracking codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Google Analytics (GA)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic, currently as a platform inside the Google Marketing Platform brand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Data layer</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A data layer is a JavaScript object that is used to pass information from your website to your Tag Manager container. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Tags</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tags are segments of code provided by analytics, marketing, and support vendors to help you integrate their products into your websites or mobile apps. With Google Tag Manager, you no longer need to add these tags directly to your projects. Instead, you configure and publish tags and how they fire from within the Tag Manager user interface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Triggers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tags fire in response to events. In Google Tag Manager, a trigger listens to your web page or mobile app for certain types of events like form submissions, button clicks, or page views. The trigger tells the tag to fire when the specified event is detected. Every tag must have at least one trigger in order to fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Variables in Google Tag Manager are named placeholders for values that are populated when code is run on your website or mobile app. For example, the Tag Manager variable named \"Page URL\" returns the current web page URL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Setting up GTM</h2>\n<p>The best way to learn how to set up GTM is to read the Google documentation because Google will update the docs as things change. In this blog post, I'm going to give a general overview of what the process is like and I'll try to highlight any tricky areas. I suggest that you check the official documentation if you have questions.</p>\n<h3>Create account</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://tagmanager.google.com\">https://tagmanager.google.com</a></li>\n<li>Fill out fields</li>\n<li>Container = your </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Add GTM to site</h3>\n<h3>Add tags, triggers and variables to GTM</h3>\n<h3>Connect to Google analytics</h3>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager#topic=3441530\">Google Tag Manager Help</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en\">Setup and install Tag Manager</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/google-tag-manager-glossary/\">The Ultimate Google Tag Manager Glossary (160+ terms)</a></p>"},"contentfulBlogImage":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/google-tag-manager/"}}
