With Google Tag Manager, you no longer need to add these tags directly to your projects. Instead, you configure and publish tags and how they fire from within the Tag Manager user interface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Triggers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tags fire in response to events. In Google Tag Manager, a trigger listens to your web page or mobile app for certain types of events like form submissions, button clicks, or page views. The trigger tells the tag to fire when the specified event is detected. Every tag must have at least one trigger in order to fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Variables </p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Set up</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create account</li>\n<li>Add GTM to site </li>\n<li>Add tags, triggers and variables to GTM </li>\n<li>Connect to Google analytics</li>\n</ul>"},"contentfulBlogImage":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/google-tag-manager/"}}
